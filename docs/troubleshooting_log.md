# Troubleshooting Log

This document summarizes the issues encountered and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Issue 1: Build Error - Module Not Found (`@utilssupabase` or `@utils/supabase`)

*   **Symptom:** The application failed to build with an error message indicating that the module `@utilssupabase` or `@utils/supabase` could not be resolved.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   Checked `tsconfig.json` and found the path alias `@/*` was configured correctly.
    *   Searched for the incorrect import strings in the project, but couldn't find them initially.
    *   After several attempts, I was able to narrow down the issue to incorrect import paths in `pages/login.tsx` and `pages/index.tsx`.
    *   The import `from "@/utils/supabase"` was incorrect because there was no `index.ts` file in the `utils/supabase` directory.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  Corrected the import path in `pages/login.tsx` and `pages/index.tsx` to `from "@/utils/supabase/client"`.
    2.  Initially, this still caused issues because `utils/supabase/client.ts` was not exporting a `supabase` object directly.
    3.  Modified `utils/supabase/client.ts` to create and export a `supabase` client instance.

## Issue 2: Build Error - Module Not Found (`@supabase/auth-helpers-react`)

*   **Symptom:** The application failed to build with an error message indicating that the module `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` could not be resolved.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   Checked the `package.json` file and found that `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` was not listed as a dependency.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  Installed the missing package by running `npm install @supabase/auth-helpers-react`.

## Issue 3: Runtime Error - `Link` is not defined

*   **Symptom:** The application threw a `ReferenceError: Link is not defined` in the browser.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   The error was reported in `pages/index.tsx`.
    *   Checked the file and found that the `Link` component from `next/link` was being used without being imported.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  Added `import Link from "next/link";` to the top of `pages/index.tsx`.
